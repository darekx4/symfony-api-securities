Coding Challenge - Symfony API. JSON based DSL securities analytics
=====

The goal of the project is to build a small interpreter for a JSON 
based DSL that performs some simple analytics on a data set. 

This should be exposed as a Symfony-based API that accepts the queries.

Used Symfony 5, PHP 7.4 and phpunit tests
 
## The Data

The data set comprises 3 small csv files, `securities.csv`,
 `attributes.csv` and `facts.csv`. There are 10 securities and 10 attributes, and for each 
 security and each attribute, there is one fact. I.e. there is a one-to-many relationship between
  securities and facts, and attributes and facts.
  
### Securities Schema

| column | type    |
|--------|---------|
| id     | integer |
| symbol | string  |

### Attributes Schema

| column | type    |
|--------|---------|
| id     | integer |
| name   | string  |

### Facts Schema

| column      | type    |
|-------------|---------|
| securityId  | integer |
| attributeId | integer |
| value       | float   |


## The DSL
A query in our DSL has the basic format:
```
{
  "security": <String>,
  "expression": <Expression>
}
```

The security property contains a single string, which is the symbol of a security the user wishes
 to evaluate an expression for.

The expression field contains a single expression, which the user wishes to evaluate for the 
chosen security. An expression contains an operator (the `fn` property), and the arguments to 
that operator has other properties. The arguments to operators can either be the name of an 
attribute, a number, or another expression.
 
You only have to implement one operator, though it should be clear in your solution 
how it might be possible to extend the interpreter to include additional operators. Please choose
 one of the following operators to implement:
 
| Operator  | Arguments| Behaviour
|-----------|----------|-----------
| +         | a, b     | Adds a and b
| -         | a, b     | Subtracts b from a
| *         | a, b     | Multiplies a and b
| /         | a, b     | Divides a by b


Here are some example queries, demonstrating what each operator looks like and what the different
 parameters can be:
 
 This one uses the `*` operator and makes use of one attribute name and an integer as its arguments: 
```
{
  "expression": {"fn": "*", "a": "sales", "b": 2},
  "security": "BBIG"
}
```

This one uses the `/` operator and makes uses two attribute names as arguments:
```
{
  "expression": {"fn": "/", "a": "price", "b": "eps"},
  "security": "HYDR"
}
```

This one uses the `-` operator and the arguments are two expressions, which in turn use the `-` 
operator and attribute names as arguments:
```
{
  "expression": {
    "fn": "-", 
    "a": {"fn": "-", "a": "eps", "b": "shares"}, 
    "b": {"fn": "-", "a": "assets", "b": "liabilities"}
  },
  "security": "SHIPW"
}
```
